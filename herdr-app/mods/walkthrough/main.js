// Walkthrough: a change read in the order it makes sense. Claude groups the
// diff's hunks into steps, orders them, and explains each one; the code of
// each step is shown under its explanation.
//
// Opened with `mod.open:walkthrough` as a dialog over the shown space, or as a
// pane: `pane.split {direction: "right", mod: "walkthrough", props: {folder?, scope?}}`.
