# Operation boundaries

Keep explicit authorization and backup for live databases, destructive
changes, deployment, publication and security-sensitive operations. A request
for implementation is not permission for unrelated production changes.
Distinguish editing a migration source from executing it on a live database.

Work solo unless delegation was specifically approved. Workers never approve
other workers. Read-only tools are preferred for investigation. Use the
smallest meaningful runtime check for code; no automatic validation of prose.

One owner handles shared build resources. Inspect real command effects.
Timeouts do not prove child exit. Runtime permissions and approval policies
remain owned by the active harness.
